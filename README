This repository contains a Capistrano config to deploy OpenEyes to your server. There are development and staging
configs for the servers used by the core OpenEyes team and Moorfields Eye Hospital. To deploy to your own servers 
the repository will need to be forked and your own configuration added. As OpenEyes uses Composer to manage 
dependencies this module requires the capistrano-composer gem from https://github.com/capistrano/composer.
