This is a capistrano config that can be used to deploy openeyes and associated repositories.

For information on how to install and use capistrano see http://capistranorb.com/

This configuration makes use of `capistrano-multiconfig` to allow multiple deployments in one configuration. https://github.com/railsware/capistrano-multiconfig

The commands to deploy follow exactly the file structure in the deploy folder, eg:

`cap portal:api:staging deploy`

will deploy the portal api staging configuration.

Staging configs accept a branch to define which release branch you want to deploy, eg:

`cap portal:api:staging deploy branch=release/v1.1.0`

The script uses SSH forwarding to check out private code from github. So you will not 
only need to have your key added in the authorized keys of the deploy user on any 
server you wish to deploy to but also have ssh-add'ed the github SSH key you use
to check out the repository you are deploying.
