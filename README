This is a capistrano config that can be used to deploy openeyes and associated repositories.

For information on how to install and use capistrano see http://capistranorb.com/

This configuration makes use of `capistrano-multiconfig` to allow multiple deployments in one configuration. https://github.com/railsware/capistrano-multiconfig

The commands to deploy follow exactly the file structure in the deploy folder, eg:

`cap portal:api:staging deploy`

will deploy the portal api staging configuration.

Staging configs accept a branch to define which release branch you want to deploy, eg:

`cap portal:api:staging deploy branch=release/v1.1.0`
